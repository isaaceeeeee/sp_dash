S&amp;P market data dash. Enjoy :)

So, this dash uses yahoo finance S&P data for all listed companies on the S&P fund (scraped from wiki)
    
We also compare the individual equity performance to the S&P fund overall to gauge performance

I've also added some useful stickers for high level numerics :)) Enjoy
