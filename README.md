S&amp;P market data dash. idk why but I've added some ARIMA and Baye's modelling as well as some high-level quants and comparison to overall fund performance for each stock. Enjoy :)

'''
    So, this dash uses yahoo finance S&P data for all listed companies on the S&P fund (scraped from wiki)
    We then use ARIMA modelling to forecast the market price using the historical data and a set confidence level
    !! 
        Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) rely solely on timeseries data to predict moving averages in pricing.
    !!
    We also compare the individual equity performance to the S&P fund overall to gauge performance
    I've also added some useful stickers for high level numerics :)) Enjoy
